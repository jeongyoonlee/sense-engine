## Sense Platform dashboard creation utilities

This package gives you everything you need to run your favorite programming language or console-based application as a dashboard on [the Sense Platform](senseplatform.com)'s cloud infrastructure, using the same user interface as the official dashboards. 

User-defined dashboards are [npm](npmjs.org) modules that export a single function, which complies with the specification documented below. Their package.json files must have an entry called `sense`. There are three example dashboards to get you started in the examples folder.

To deploy a custom dashboard, simply stick it in `/home/sense/node_modules` in one of your projects. When you launch dashboards from that project in the future, the new dashboard type will be available in the drop-down menu.

### The exported function

Your dashboard module should export a function of a single argument called `createDashboard`. The argument will be a dashboard instance, and the function should add the following attributes to it:

```javascript
exports.createDashboard = function(dashboard) {

  dashboard.complete = function(codeString, cb) {
    // Passes an array of completions to the callback.
  }

  dashboard.chunk = function(codeString, cb) {
    // Splits the code up into chunks, which may be statements, 
    // comments, etc. puts them in an array, and passes them to 
    // the callback. These chunks will be sent to dashboard.execute 
    // one at a time.
  }

  dashboard.interrupt = function() {
    // Returns nothing, but interrupts the dashboard somehow. This is 
    // often accomplished by running the dashboard in a worker and using 
    // worker.kill 'SIGINT'.
  }

  dashboard.execute = function(chunk, next) {
    // This function should send one chunk output by dashboard.chunk
    // to the dashboard's engine for execution, and should call 'next' 
    // once the execution is complete and any result has been passed 
    // to one of the output methods documented below. 'next' can be 
    // called from a callback if that is easier. This function can
    // return before 'next' is called.
  }

};
```

It is important that none of these functions runs for a long time so that node.js is free to listen for incoming events. The execute function, in particular, should usually delegate to a separate thread or process.

The following output methods of the dashboard can be called at any time to handle output from the dashboard. In particular, they allow the 'execute' function to output any result or error associated with a chunk of code.

```javascript
// Display the string as plain text output.
dashboard.text(string)

// This string is a chunk of code that was passed into the 
// dashboard. Echo it as syntax-highlighted text.
dashboard.code(string)

// Display the string as an error.
dashboard.error(string)

// Display the string as a warning.
dashboard.warning(string)

// The string is a comment chunk that was passed into the 
// dashboard. Display it as comment-colored text.
dashboard.comment(string)

// The string is HTML that was generated by compiling Markdown.
// Display it as such.
dashboard.markdown(string)

// The string is a nonstandard prompt that the dashboard has 
// presented.
dashboard.prompt(string)

// The string is HTML and should be displayed as such.
dashboard.html(string)

// The string is a Javascript widget that should be embedded in
// the output.
dashboard.widget(string)
```

### The `sense` entry in package.json

The `sense` entry signals that your dashboard is in fact a dashboard, tells the UI what name to give it in the dashboard types menu, tells it how to highlight code typed into the dashboard, etc. For example:

```javascript
{
  ...,
  "sense": {
    "name": "CustomDashboard",
    "mode": "my-language",
    "fileExtensions": ["cd", "custdash", "customdashboard"],
    "lineComment": ""
  }
}
```

### Testing from the command line

If your dashboard fails to launch on Sense, we'll do our best to report the error to you; but it's much easier to run your dashboard in a command line-based repl while developing and testing it, and then deploy to Sense after you're pretty sure it works.

To do this, type 

```javascript
require('sense-dashboard').repl(dashboardModule, [startupScript])
```

into node.js. The option startupScript argument is the name of a file containing code. The dashboard will execute the file's contents before taking any more input. All the dashboards in the examples folder have executable command-line versions in their `bin` folders.

In the repl, you can switch into multiline mode by pressing ctrl-v. In multiline mode, the repl will accumulate the code you type or paste in until it sees a blank line.
